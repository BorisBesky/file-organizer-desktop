## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd file-organizer-desktop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Building the Application

### Prerequisites for Building

Before building the Tauri application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **Rust and Cargo** (latest stable version)
  
  To install Rust and Cargo:
  
  1. Visit [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/) or run the appropriate command for your platform:
     
     **Windows:**
     ```powershell
     # Download and run rustup-init.exe from https://rustup.rs/
     # Or use winget:
     winget install Rustlang.Rustup
     ```
     
     **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```
  
  2. Follow the on-screen instructions (typically just press Enter to accept defaults)
  
  3. **IMPORTANT:** After installation, you **must restart your terminal** (close and reopen) for the changes to take effect.
     
     Alternatively, on Windows PowerShell, you can manually add Cargo to your current session:
     ```powershell
     $env:PATH += ";$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin"
     ```
     
     On macOS/Linux, run:
     ```bash
     source $HOME/.cargo/env  # macOS/Linux
     ```
  
  4. Verify installation:
     ```bash
     rustc --version
     cargo --version
     ```

- **Platform-specific dependencies:**
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Linux**: See [Tauri prerequisites for Linux](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-linux)
  - **Windows**: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools

### Development Build

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

This will create platform-specific installers in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` directory:

- **macOS**: `.app` bundle and `.dmg` installer in `bundle/macos/`
- **Windows**: `.msi` installer in `bundle/msi/` and `.exe` in `bundle/nsis/`
- **Linux**: `.deb`, `.AppImage`, or other formats in `bundle/deb/`, `bundle/appimage/`, etc.

### Build Output Locations

After building, you can find the compiled application at:

- **Development**: `src-tauri/target/debug/`
- **Production**: `src-tauri/target/release/`
- **Installers**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

### Customizing the Build

You can customize the build configuration by editing:
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Tauri app configuration (app name, version, window settings, etc.)
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies and metadata
- `vite.config.ts` - Frontend build configuration

### Code Signing (macOS/Windows)

For distribution, you'll need to sign your application:

- **macOS**: Configure your Apple Developer certificate in `tauri.conf.json` under `tauri.bundle.macOS`
- **Windows**: Configure code signing certificate in `tauri.conf.json` under `tauri.bundle.windows`

Refer to the [Tauri documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/sign-macos) for detailed signing instructions.

## Usage

### Application Modes

The application has two main modes that you can switch between using the mode buttons in the header:

#### **Organize Mode** (AI-Powered File Organization)
- Use the application to select a directory and organize files based on AI classification.
- Review and edit proposed file names and categories before applying changes.
- The AI will suggest appropriate categories and filenames based on file content.

#### **Analyze Mode** (Find Duplicate, Unused, and Unreferenced Files)
- Detect and manage problematic files in your directories.
- Three analysis types available:
  - **Duplicates**: Find files with identical content using SHA256 hashing
  - **Unused**: Identify files not accessed within a specified number of days
  - **Unreferenced**: Locate files that aren't referenced by other files in the project

### File Analysis Features

#### **Finding Duplicate Files**
- The app scans your directory and calculates SHA256 hashes for all files
- Groups files with identical content together
- Shows wasted disk space from duplicates
- Automatically keeps the first copy and allows you to select others for deletion
- Files are sorted by size (largest duplicates first) to help prioritize cleanup

#### **Finding Unused Files**
- Identifies files based on last access time
- Configurable threshold (default: 90 days)
- Shows days since last access for each file
- Displays file sizes to help prioritize cleanup
- Useful for cleaning up old downloads, temporary files, or forgotten archives

#### **Finding Unreferenced Files**
- Scans text-based files (code, config, documentation) for file references
- Identifies files that aren't imported, required, or referenced by other files
- Helps find orphaned assets, unused dependencies, or forgotten files
- Supports various reference patterns (relative paths, imports, includes, etc.)

#### **Bulk Operations**
- Select individual files or use "Select All" for batch operations
- Delete selected files with confirmation
- View detailed information (size, last access date, etc.)
- Click on file paths to open files directly in your default application

### Basic Operation (Organize Mode)
- Use the application to select a directory and organize files based on AI classification.
- Review and edit proposed file names and categories before applying changes.

### LLM Provider Options
The application supports multiple AI providers for file classification:

- **Managed Local LLM**: Run a local LLM server automatically managed by the app. No manual setup required - select a model and the server will be downloaded and started automatically.
- **LM Studio**: Local AI server. Start LM Studio and load a model first (default: http://localhost:1234)
- **Ollama**: Local AI server. Install and run Ollama with a model like llama2 or mistral (default: http://localhost:11434)
- **OpenAI**: Cloud service requiring API key from platform.openai.com
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Cloud service requiring API key from console.anthropic.com
- **Groq**: Fast cloud inference requiring API key from console.groq.com
- **Google Gemini**: Google AI service requiring API key from ai.google.dev
- **Custom**: Any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint

### Scan Control Features
The application now supports advanced scan control:

#### **Pause/Resume Scan**
- While scanning is in progress, click the "Pause" button to temporarily halt the process
- The scan state is preserved, showing progress and partial results
- Click "Resume" to continue from where you left off
- Progress bar updates to show paused state

#### **Stop Scan**
- Click "Stop" during scanning or while paused to permanently halt the process
- When stopped, the application will:
  - Display a preview of all files scanned up to that point
  - Automatically send current results to LM Studio for category optimization
  - Allow you to review and approve the partial results
  - Show "Stopped at user request" in the progress indicator

#### **New Scan**
- After completing or stopping a scan, use "New Scan" to start fresh
- This resets all scan state and clears previous results

### LM Studio Integration
- Configure your LM Studio base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:1234/v1`)
- Select your preferred model for file classification
- The app automatically sends partial results to LM Studio for optimization when scans are stopped
- Category optimization suggestions are applied automatically and logged in the status area

### Real-time Feedback
- Status area shows detailed progress of file reading and classification
- Progress bar displays current file count and percentage completed
- Scan state indicators (Scanning, Paused, Stopped, Completed) provide clear status
